    </strong>
</p>
<p>
This Kalium Mobile Application End User License Agreement ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") is a binding agreement between you ("<strong>End User</strong>," "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>") and <strong>Kakitu Securities LTD </strong>("<strong>Kakitu Securities</strong>",<strong> </strong>" <strong>we</strong>", <strong>"our</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>").
    This Agreement governs your use on your mobile device of the compiled,
    executable <strong>Kakitu Wallet </strong>mobile application released by
us, and all related documentation (collectively, the "    <strong>Application</strong>").
</p>
<p>
    The Application is licensed (not sold) to you, pursuant to and subject to
    your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
</p>

    <strong><u>DISCLAIMER: PLEASE READ THIS FIRST</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    THE APPLICATION IS OWNED, OPERATED AND RELEASED BY KAKITU SECURITIES
    ONLY. KAKITU SECURITIES IS INDEPENDENT OF, AND OPERATES SEPARATELY FROM,
    THE ENTITIES INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING, OPERATING, MAINTAINING OR SUPPORTING
    THE KAKITU PROTOCOL, THE KAKITU BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK, THE KAKITU CURRENCY OR ANY
    SOFTWARE WALLET THAT IS NOT RELEASED BY KAKITU SECURITIES (COLLECTIVELY,
    "<strong>SEPARATE TECHNOLOGIES</strong>"). FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, 
    KAKITU SECURITIES LTD DOES NOT OWN, DEVELOP, OPERATE, MAINTAIN OR SUPPORT ANY OF
    THE SEPARATE TECHNOLOGIES.
</p>
<p>
    KAKITU SECURITIES IS NOT A BANK, CUSTODIAN OR OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANY AND
    DOES NOT PROVIDE BANKING, CUSTODIAL OR OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES. THE
    APPLICATION IS NOT A BANKING, CUSTODIAL OR OTHER SERVICE. YOUR USE OF THE
    APPLICATION AND YOUR CREATION AND ACCESSING OF A WALLET ON THE KAKITU BLOCK
    LATTICE NETWORK (A "<strong>WALLET</strong>") USING THE APPLICATION DOES
    NOT INVOLVE THE OPENING, ESTABLISHING OR MANAGING OF AN "ACCOUNT" WITH KAKITU SECURITIES; INSTEAD, YOU ARE SIMPLY USING THE APPLICATION TO INTERACT WITH THE KAKITU BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK AND YOUR WALLET/ACCOUNTS ON
    THE KAKITU BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK.
</p>
<p>
    A "<strong>WALLET SEED</strong>" IS A UNIQUE CODE THAT IS PROVIDED TO YOU
    BY THE APPLICATION, THROUGH ITS DIRECT INTERACTION WITH THE KAKITU BLOCK
    LATTICE NETWORK (I.E., WITHOUT OUR INVOLVEMENT) WHEN YOU FIRST CREATE A NEW
    WALLET USING THE APPLICATION. YOUR WALLET SEED IS THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU TO
    RECOVER YOUR WALLET ON THE KAKITU BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK AND ACCESS ANY KAKITU
    CURRENCY YOU STORE IN THAT WALLET.
</p>
<p>
    WE DO NOT RECEIVE, COLLECT, RECORD, STORE OR HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR WALLET
    SEED. THEREFORE, WE CANNOT RECOVER IT FOR YOU IF YOU LOSE IT AND WE CANNOT
    PROVIDE YOU WITH ACCESS TO ANY KAKITU CURRENCY THAT YOU STORE IN YOUR WALLET.
    YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR RECORDING YOUR WALLET SEED IN A SAFE AND
    SECURE PLACE AND MANNER. DO NOT SHARE YOUR WALLET SEED WITH ANYONE, OR
    PERMIT ANYONE TO USE YOUR MOBILE DEVICE ON WHICH THE APPLICATION IS
    INSTALLED WHO YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR WALLET OR YOUR KAKITU
    CURRENCY.
</p>
<p>
    ANY KAKITU CURRENCY THAT YOU CHOOSE TO ACCESS, HOLD, STORE, MANAGE, RECEIVE,
    SEND OR TRANSMIT USING THE APPLICATION, AND ANY BALANCE AND TRANSACTION
    INFORMATION RELATING TO IT, ARE NEVER ACCESSED, HELD, STORED, MANAGED,
    RECEIVED, SENT OR TRANSMITTED BY KAKITU SECURITIES.
</p>

<p>
    YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECURITY OF YOUR MOBILE DEVICE, YOUR
    KAKITU CURRENCY, AND YOUR WALLET SEED. KAKITU SECURITIES IS NOT AND WILL
    NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE SECURITY OR PROTECTION OF YOUR
    KAKITU CURRENCY OR WALLET SEED.
</p>
<p>
    YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND KAKITU SECURITIES
    DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THE
    SECURITY, COMPATIBILITY, SUITABILITY OR RELIABILITY OF THE APPLICATION OR
    ANY KAKITU CURRENCY THAT YOU ACCESS, HOLD, STORE, MANAGE, RECEIVE, SEND OR
